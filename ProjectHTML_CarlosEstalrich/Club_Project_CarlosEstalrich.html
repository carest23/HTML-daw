                Valencia CF was established on 5 March 1919 and officially approved on 18 March 1919, with Octavio
                Augusto Milego Díaz as its first president; incidentally the presidency was decided by a coin toss. The
                club played its first competitive match away from home on 21 May 1919 against Valencia Gimnástico, and
                lost the match 1–0.

                Valencia CF moved into the Mestalla stadium in 1923, having played its home matches at the Algirós
                ground since 7 December 1919. The first match at Mestalla pitted the home side against Castellón
                Castalia and ended a 0-0 draw. In another match the day after, Valencia won against the same opposition
                1–0. Valencia CF won the Regional Championship in 1923, and was eligible to play in the domestic Copa
                del Rey cup competition for the first time in its history.

            <h3 id="ESuccess">European successes</h3>
            <p>
                While managing indifferent league form in the early 1960s, the club had its first European success in
                the form of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (the forerunner to the UEFA Cup). In the 1961–62 season, Valencia
                beat FC Barcelona in the final. The 1962–63 edition of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final pitted Valencia
                against Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb, which the Valencians also won. Valencia was again present in the
                Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final in the 1963–64 season, but was defeated 2–1 by Real Zaragoza from Spain.

                Former two-time European Footballer of the Year award winner Alfredo Di Stéfano was hired as coach in
                1970, and immediately inspired his new club to their fourth La Liga championship and first since 1947.
                This secured Valencia its first qualification for the prestigious European Cup, contested by the various
                European domestic champions. Valencia reached the third round of the 1971–72 competition before losing
                both legs to Hungarian champions Újpesti Dózsa. In 1972 The club also finished runners up both in La
                Liga and the domestic cup, losing to Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid, respectively. The most notable
                players of the 1970s era include Austrian midfielder Kurt Jara, forward Johnny Rep of the Netherlands
                and Argentinian forward Mario Kempes, who became the La Liga topscorer for two consecutive seasons in
                1976–77 and 1977–78. Valencia would go on to win the Copa del Rey again in the 1978–79 season, and also
                capture the European Cup Winners' Cup the next season, after beating English club Arsenal in the final,
                with Kempes spearheading Valencia's success in Europe.

            <h3 id="2010">The 2010s: Debt issues and stability</h3>
            <p>
                No solution had yet been found to address the massive debt Valencia were faced with, and rumours
                persisted that top talents such as David Villa, Juan Mata, and David Silva could leave the club to help
                balance the books. In the first season of the new decade, Valencia returned to the UEFA Champions League
                for the first time since the 2007–08 season, as they finished comfortably in third in the 2009–10 La
                Liga season. However, in the summer of 2010, due to financial reasons, David Villa and David Silva were
                sold to Barcelona and Manchester City, respectively, to reduce the club's massive debt. But, despite the
                loss of two of the club's most important players, the team was able to finish comfortably in third again
                2010–11 La Liga for the second season running, although they were eliminated from the Champions League
                by German side Schalke 04 in the Round of 16. In the summer of 2011, then current captain Juan Mata was
                sold to Chelsea to further help Valencia's precarious financial situation. It was announced by President
                Manuel Llorente that the club's debt had been decreased and that the work on the new stadium will
                restart as soon as possible, sometime in 2012.
            </p>

            <h3 id="PLim">Peter Lim's ownership</h3>
            <p>
                During the 2012–13 season, Ernesto Valverde was announced as the new manager but after failing to
                qualify for the Champions League, he stepped down and was replaced by Miroslav Đukić. On 5 July 2013,
                Amadeo Salvo was named as the new president of the club. Almost a month after Salvo was named president,
                on 1 August 2013, Valencia sold star striker Roberto Soldado to English club Tottenham Hotspur for a
                reported fee of €30 million. Miroslav Đukić was sacked six months into the 2013–14 season after just 6
                wins in his first 16 matches, Valencia's worst start in 15 years. He was replaced by Juan Antonio
                Pizzi on 26 December 2013. Under Pizzi, Valencia reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Europa League,
                where they lost to eventual winners Sevilla on away goals and finished 8th in La Liga despite a
                disastrous start to the season.
                In the summer of 2016, André Gomes and Paco Alcácer were both sold to Barcelona and Shkodran Mustafi was
                sold to Arsenal, while Ezequiel Garay and former Manchester United player Nani were brought
                in. Pako Ayestarán was sacked on 21 September 2016 after four-straight defeats at
                the beginning of the 2016–17 season. Former Italy national team head coach Cesare Prandelli was
                hired as his replacement on 28 September. However, he resigned after just three months on 30
                December, claiming the club had made him false transfer promises. Days later, on 7 January 2017,
                Valencia sporting director Jesús García Pitarch also resigned, saying he felt like he was being used as
                a shield for criticism by the club and that he could not defend something he no longer believed
                in. Voro was named caretaker manager for the fifth time until the end of season, with Valencia
                in 17th position and in danger of relegation. However, results improved under Voro and he steered
                Valencia clear off relegation, ultimately finishing the season in 12th place. On 27 March, Mateu
                Alemany was named the new director general of Valencia.

                The club also announced club president Lay Hoon Chan had submitted her resignation and that she would be
                replaced by Anil Murthy. After rumors arose of Lim's attempts at selling the club, Murthy assured
                the fans and local media that Valencia was a long-term project for both him and Lim, and they would not
                consider selling the club. For the following season, former Villarreal coach Marcelino was named
                the new manager on 12 May.

                After a successful first season under Marcelino, the club secured 4th position and a return to the
                Champions League. Valencia also reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Europa League. On 25 May 2019,
                Valencia won the Copa del Rey for the first time since 2008, upsetting FC Barcelona in the final.
