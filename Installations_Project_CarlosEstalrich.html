                <h3>MESTALLA</h3>
                <p>The prestigious British newspaper 'The Telegraph' published a special report in their sports section
                    about the 20 greatest grounds in European football when FC Barcelona announced their intention to
                    revamp their ground for the 2020/21 campaign. Mestalla was ranked second. ‘The Telegraph’ describes
                    the stadium by saying: ”The steepest stands of any major ground in Europe still take your breath
                    away, even if you have seen them a thousand times”.
                    Mestalla was ranked above other Spanish grounds such as the Camp Nou, Santiago Bernabéu and Vicente
                    Calderón, as well as other legendary grounds like the Parc des Princes, Anfield, Allianz Arena, Old
                    Trafford, and the Giuseppe Meazza.</p>

                    The current, remodelled Ciudad Deportiva was opened on February 19th, 1992. As time went by, the
                    land came to be used as the first team training pitch and the football school.

                    The Ciudad Deportiva covers 180,000m2. Besides the design to hold its school for future players and
                    halls of residence, it also features a modern rehabilitation centre with various rooms, for players
                    to recover from injuries.

                    Valencia CF's sports facilities continue to grow, providing the best conditions for the hundreds of
                    athletes who use them everyday. The most recent additions have come in the firm of training ramps
                    and a 'footvolley' court.
                    The Ciudad Deportiva is considered to be amongst the best in Europe, at the same level as other
                    legendary football facilities.
